# OpenGL Project

The subject of this project is the implementation of a 3D graphics application developed in C++ with OpenGL support.
The scene that I implemented is a military shooting range with moving targets, weapons, a truck and two tents. The user can move around the scene see the features implemented such as lights, shadows, animations, physics and collisions.
